Respected Sir,  
  
I am working on a project: Curiousity++. As part of this project, I would like to interact with your college B.Tech first year CSE students for 2 hours. And answer all the questions they have about the Information Technology domain. The project details are @ [bcse.me/project](https://bcse.me/project)  
  
Looking forward to having a session in your college sir. Can you please let me know what would be the right time to interact with students.  
  
Thanking you,  
Rohini Kumar Barla
