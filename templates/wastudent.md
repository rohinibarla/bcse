Dear Student,  
  
My name is Rohini Kumar Barla, I worked in the Windows OS team for 7 years in Microsoft and worked in other areas in software for over 15 years.  
  
I am working on a project: Curiousity++.  
  
B.Tech students have many questions about how the software they use is built and why it is built that way. To feed this curiosity with the right information and provide them further pointers to explore and avenues to do hands-on to understand in depth. Today the world has enough resources to address everyone's needs. Many of the resources which are costly a decade ago are mostly now available for free (in some pockets of the internet) to experiment. I would like to expose the students to the working of the software artifacts they come across. I am interested in the questions in the minds of B.Tech students.   
  
Details of the project are @ [bcse.me/project](https://bcse.me/project)

Thanking you,
