# Curiousity++

###### Feed the curiosity of the B.Tech student and turn it into interested in the domain.

B.Tech students have many questions about how the software they use is built and why it is built that way. Primarily the B.Tech first-year students ask the questions without any hesitation. As they move to later years, they feel they should know some things to ask, so they gradually stop asking questions. And ignore the itch to explore stuff. In some students, it's still alive.

**To feed this curiosity with the right information and provide them further pointers to explore and avenues to do hands-on to understand in depth.** Today the world has enough resources to address everyone's needs. Many of the resources which are costly a decade ago are mostly now available for free (in some pockets of the internet) to experiment. I would like to expose the students to the working of the software artifacts they come across. I have worked in the Windows OS team for 7 years and worked in the iOS domain for 6 years. I have interacted with more than a thousand students in the past 3 years. Details of my [work experience](https://linkedin.com/in/rohinikumarbarla). I am interested in the questions in the minds of B.Tech first-year students and children. 

What will I do collecting all these questions?  
I will post the answers @ [bcse.me](https://bcse.me)
